# Todo-List Application
This is a simple **Todo-List**.I have built using **HTML,CSS,Javasvript** Here the user can **Add,Edit,Delete,Mark task as completed and save** their tasks using **Local Storage** 

The use can also mark them as completed once it's done. 

In this manner i have implemented some features

## Features:

**ADD Task** : User can add new task
**Edit Task**: user can modify existing task
**Delete Task**: user can delete tasks
**Mark as Complete**: User can mark tasks once it's done
**Save Todo-list Local Storage**: Tasks are saved even after refreshing the tasks

- **HTML** : Used for basic structure
- **CSS** : Used for styling 
- **Bootstrap** : Used for responsive
- **Javascript** : Used for dynamic part
- **Local Storage** : Used for data persistance
